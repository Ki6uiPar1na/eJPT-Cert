# Logger

Purpose

Logger provides a comprehensive record of traffic and events that occur during a Burp session. It is broader in scope than HTTP History and useful for auditing and retrospection.

What it captures

- Requests and responses across Burp tools.
- High-level events and notable actions performed during a session.

Differences vs HTTP History

- HTTP History focuses specifically on HTTP(S) traffic details and is the primary place for request/response inspection.
- Logger acts as a wider audit trail for actions, useful when you need a chronological summary of activities during an engagement.

Practical tip

- Use Logger when building a timeline of testing activities for reports or when needing to retrace complex sequences of actions.
