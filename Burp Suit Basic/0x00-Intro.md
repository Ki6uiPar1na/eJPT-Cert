# Burp Suite — Introduction

A concise reference covering Burp Suite's primary tools and their purpose. This document is intended as a quick orientation for hands-on web application testing.

Key tools and short descriptions:

- Target — Manage and organize the testing scope and view a site map of discovered pages.
- Proxy — Intercept, inspect, and modify HTTP(S) traffic between your browser and the server.
- Intruder — Automated attacks for fuzzing and brute-force testing of parameters and forms.
- Repeater — Manual request editing and replay for iterative testing.
- Sequencer — Statistical analysis of token randomness (session IDs, CSRF tokens).
- Decoder — Encode/decode and transform data (Base64, URL, Hex, etc.).
- Comparer — Visual differences between two pieces of data (responses, files).
- Logger — Broad logging of traffic and events for auditing.
- Organizer — Save findings, notes, and statuses during an engagement.
- Extensions — Add plugins (BApp Store or manual) to extend Burp's capabilities.

Note on editions: The Community edition is powerful but has slower features in places (e.g., Intruder). The Professional edition adds advanced features such as Collaborator, faster scans, and active scanning enhancements.

Ethics reminder: Only test systems you own or have explicit authorization to test. Unauthorized testing is illegal.
