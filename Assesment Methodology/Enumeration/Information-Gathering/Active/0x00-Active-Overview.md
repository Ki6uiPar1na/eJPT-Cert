# 0x00 Active Information Gathering - Overview

Active reconnaissance interacts with target systems and can be noisy. Use only with explicit authorization.

Common activities:
- Host discovery (ping sweeps, ARP scans)
- Port scanning (TCP/UDP)
- Service and version detection
- OS fingerprinting
- DNS zone transfers and brute forcing

Tools: `nmap`, `netdiscover`, `dnsenum`, `masscan`, `subfinder`, `amass`.
